### Hi there, I am Gueorgui (pronounced Georgi)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a start-up app using the MERN stack. I am also very much a Java fan and love to solve coding challenges in Java on LeetCode and CodeWars.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that help the planet, the environment and animals or combat poverty and climate change.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for mentoring on building large-scale apps.
